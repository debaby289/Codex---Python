In fintech, we often perform a time series analysis on stocks. This means that we need to analyze a stock, given its price over a certain time. 📈

In this exercise, we will perform a simplified version of a time series analysis. The stock that we will be analyzing is the $AMC stock in January 2023.

Here are the stock prices (in dollars) for each of these weekdays:
    stock_prices = [34.68, 36.09, 34.94, 33.97, 34.68, 35.82, 43.41, 44.29, 44.65, 53.56, 49.85, 48.71, 48.71, 49.94, 48.53, 47.03, 46.59, 48.62, 44.21, 47.21]

Create a stock_analysis.py program that implements three functions:
    price_at(x) that finds the price on a given day x.
    max_price(a, b) that finds the maximum price from day a to day b.
    min_price(a, b) that finds the minimum price from day a to day b.

The parameters of the days will be in the range of 1 to 20 (since that is the period for the stock we are analyzing).

Make sure to call each function to test if your functions work correctly!

def price_at(x):
    return stock_prices[x - 1]   # adjust for 1-based input

def max_price(a, b):
    return max(stock_prices[a - 1:b])   # slice the list

def min_price(a, b):
    return min(stock_prices[a - 1:b])
