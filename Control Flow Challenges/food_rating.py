Instructions
In a five-star restaurant review system (⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️), the stars represent different levels of satisfaction. But what does each star rating actually mean?

Start by creating a rating variable and assign it a decimal number between 0 and 5.

Next, make a rating system with an if/elif/else:
    rating greater than 4.5, print 'Perfection'
    rating greater than 4, print 'Excellent'
    rating greater than 3, print 'Good'
    rating greater than 2, print 'Fair'
    Otherwise, print 'Poor'
'''
# Write code below 💖

import random

rating = float(random.randint(0,5))

if rating > 4.5:
  print('Perfection')
elif rating > 4:
  print('Excellent')
elif rating > 3:
  print('Good')
elif rating > 2:
  print('Fair')
else:
  print('Poor')
