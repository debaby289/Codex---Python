If you slept through your geometry class, a Pythagorean theorem is the relationship between the three sides of a right triangle. It was named after the Greek philosopher Pythagoras, born around 570 BC.

Pythagorean equation looks like:

c = math.sqrt(math.pow(a,2) + math.pow(b,2))

    The a is the length of a short side.
    The b is the length of another short side.
    The c is the length of the hypotenuse.

The hypotenuse is the longest side of the right triangle.

Create a hypotenuse.py program that asks the user for two numbers, a and b, and then calculates the hypotenuse c. See the hint on how to do square root!

# Write code below 💖

import math

a = int(input('Enter a: '))
b = int(input('Enter b: '))

c = math.sqrt(math.pow(a,2) + math.pow(b,2))
print(f'Hyptonuse = {c}')
