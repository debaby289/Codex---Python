'''
A gambling machine was invented in Brooklyn around 1891. Players would insert a nickel and pull a lever. If it's a good poker hand, you win a free beer. Soon, many bars in the city had it. This was a precursor to the modern slot machine.

Create a slot_machine.py program using random.

The items are symbols of common fruits and sevens (7️⃣). In each round, the slot machine displays three random items. If there are three sevens, you win!

Final Program Output
Create a symbols list and include the following items: '🍒',' 🍇', '🍉', '7️⃣'.

Next, create a results variable that uses the .choices() method from the random module and get three random symbols. Make sure to import the required module at the top of the file!

Then, print each value from results, separated by | pipe characters:

🍉 | 🍒 | 🍇

Lastly, use an if/else statement:
    If all of the list items in results are equal to '7️⃣', print "Jackpot! 💰".
    Else, print "Thanks for playing!".

Bonus:
    Rewrite this program with a play() function.
    Add a while loop for the player to keep playing, round after round.
    Ask the player for a 'Y' or 'N' input to keep playing with input().
